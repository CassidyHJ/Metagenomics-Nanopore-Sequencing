While this is a valuable learning experience, it’s not practical for analyzing large datasets or for ensuring reproducibility in the long term.\n\nWe can make use of a tool called [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to automate the previous steps into a single pipeline. With Snakemake, you can define the steps of your analysis in a Snakefile and then let Snakemake handle the execution, dependency management and error handling.\n\n## Preparing to run the workflow\n\nTo run the automated pipeline, you need to fill out the excel sheet **file_paths.xlsx** within the **Metagenomics_automation** folder exactly as shown in the example below. Do not change the file name when saving! Here, you tell snakemake where to find your data. \n\n![Example](excel_fill.jpg)\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Warning\n\nRemember to update the run paths and barcodes for each sample!\n:::\n\nYou are nearly there!\n\nMake sure you are in the right folder to run the script.\n\n``` bash\ncd /mnt/viro0002-data/sequencedata/processed/Diagnostics_metagenomics/Metagenomics_automation/ \n```\n\nNow just copy the command below.\n\n``` bash\nsnakemake --cores 16\n```\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Tip\n\nIf its all green, everything is working. Just let it run in the background\n:::\n\nOnce the run is finished, please see the figure below to find your data. \n\n![Example](snakemake.jpg)\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Warning\nRename the **results** folder with the run name (for example Viro_Run_0001).  \nThis step is critical—if another Snakemake run is started without renaming, the previous output will be overwritten.\n:::\n\nTo rename, please use this example \n\n``` bash\ncd /mnt/viro0002-data/sequencedata/processed/Diagnostics_metagenomics/Metagenomics_automation/\nmv results Viro_Run_0001\n```\n\n### False postive findings \n\nAfter viewing the krona plot within the **krona** folder, you may want to remove some false positive findings. \n\nYou can do this by going into the **classification** folder and opening up the **report_standard.txt** file. There you can set the number of reads back to zero for the false positive finding - remember in addition to setting the number of reads, you must also set the normalized percentage. Save with the same name. \n\n::: callout-warning\n## Warning\n\nRemember to be in the correct folder\n:::\n\n``` bash\ncd /mnt/viro0002-data/sequencedata/processed/Diagnostics_metagenomics/Metagenomics_automation/Viro_Run_0001/barcode01/krona/\n```\n\nRemove the original krona plot \n\n``` bash\nrm report.html\n```\n\nThen just re-run snakemake (it will ignore previously made files and just focus on generating your updated krona plot)\n\n``` bash\nsnakemake --cores 16\n```\n\nIn order to access your krona plot (and other files) within windows, you will need permission. Paste the following into the terminal:\n\n``` bash\nchmod 777 -R /mnt/viro0002-data/sequencedata/processed/Diagnostics_metagenomics/Viro_Run_0001/\n```\nThis will take some\n\n",
