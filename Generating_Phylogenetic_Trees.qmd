A phylogenetic tree or phylogeny shows the evolutionary history between a set of species or taxa during a specific time. It can be used to indicate similarities between sequences or help identify clusters or lineages.

There are several different tools to help you build trees.

We will first build a more simplified tree using [MAFFT](https://github.com/GSLBiotech/mafft) (for alignment) and [IQ-TREE](https://github.com/iqtree/iqtree3) (estimates Maximum-Likelihood Phylogeny). We will then use [Figtree](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree) for visualization.

Make sure you have read through and completed any tasks in the **Preparation and Reference collection** chapter.

**Now make sure you are in the right path**

``` bash
cd /mnt/viro0002-data/sequencedata/processed/Diagnostics_metagenomics/Viro_Run_0001/barcode01/Tree/
```

## Sequence alignment using MAFFT

We will continue with our RVA example. We first need to align all our sequences.

``` bash
mafft -s RVA_sequences.fasta > sequences_aligned.fasta
```

🔹<strong style="color:darkblue">-s RVA_sequences.fasta</strong> – Specifies the input sequences in FASTA format. This is your “pathogen_of_interest_sequences” (in this case, Rotavirus A sequences).

::: callout-warning
## Warning

Its important to always check your new alignment file to see if there are any sequences causing problems (e.g adding extra gaps) and remove them. Then re-run the alignment again.
:::

![Example 1 - In this case, you could remove the problematic sequence if its only present in one reference](alignment_problem.jpg)

![Example 2 - An example of a high-quality alignment (e.g., no gaps, high similarity, proper coverage)](alignment_better.jpg)

## Generating phylogenetic trees using IQ-Tree

Now that you have your alignment, copy the command below:

``` bash
iqtree -s sequences_aligned.fasta -bb 1000 -st DNA -nt 16 -alrt 1000 -pre treefileout
```

🔹<strong style="color:darkblue">-s sequences_aligned.fasta</strong> – Specifies the input alignment file in FASTA format. This should contain multiple aligned sequences (in this case, Rotavirus A sequences).

🔹<strong style="color:darkblue">-bb 1000</strong> – Performs ultrafast bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates to assess the support for each branch in the phylogenetic tree.

🔹<strong style="color:darkblue">-st DNA</strong> – Indicates that the input sequences are DNA (nucleotide) sequences.

🔹<strong style="color:darkblue">-nt 16</strong> – Uses 16 CPU threads for computation, speeding up the tree-building process.

🔹<strong style="color:darkblue">-alrt 1000</strong> – Runs an approximate likelihood-ratio test (aLRT) with 1000 replicates to calculate additional support values for tree branches.

🔹<strong style="color:darkblue">-pre treefileout</strong> – Defines the prefix for all output files, such as treefileout.treefile

## Visualization using Figtree

[FigTree](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree) is a free and open sourced tree visualization tool. Although its not always suitable for large datasets and is primarily designed for rooted trees, its a quick tool to visualize your initial trees.

Start up Figtree and select open (select your new tree - **treefileout.contree**)

-root in the middle, align tip labels, tip shapes, branch labels (display by bootstrap)

Please see the figure below as an example: ![Simple tree](figtree.jpg)
