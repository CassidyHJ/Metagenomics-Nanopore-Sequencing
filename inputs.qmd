# Preparation

Before running the pipeline, ensure all required software, databases, and input files are prepared.

- Input files:
  - Raw Nanopore reads (FASTQ)
  - Sample metadata or mapping file (optional)
  - Excel file with paths/configuration

# Load Excel Config (Python Example)

```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_excel("file_paths.xlsx")  # make sure file_paths.xlsx exists
df.head()
```
